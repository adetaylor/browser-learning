# Exercise 1a: Use a real browser, spot things in HTML

* Open up Chrome (or any other browser)
* Go to https://en.wikipedia.org in that browser
* Look for:
  * Some text which is **bold** (remember what it says)
  * Some text which is _italic_ (remember what it says)
  * Some text which is a hyperlink (remember what it says)
* Choose the "view source" option (or "inspect element")
* Find the text you found

Questions:

* What's the HTML tag meaning 'bold'?
* What's the HTML tag meaning 'italic'?
* What's the HTML tag meaning hyperlink?

(you'll need to know these things later!)
