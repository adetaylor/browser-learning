# For teachers

Intended educational outcomes (this page will later be updated with references
to the UK computer science GCSE curriculum, and maybe others):

* **Get comfortable reading code**. The project will involve _reading_ a
  Python web browser containing about 100 lines of code. It will be covered
  in comments and won't assume more than basic Python knowledge - but still,
  reading large amounts of code is a skill in itself. There will be games
  based on finding the right place to add small new features, which will be
  mostly about figuring out where to add them.
* **Understand encryption.** We'll demonstrate, using a Python web
  browser and a Python web server, how unencrypted HTTP traffic can be
  intercepted, and how HTTPS can't.
* **Understand networking.** We'll see the requests and responses flowing
  back and forth between the web browser and web server.
* **Understand security bugs.** There are games to find some hidden security
  bugs in the web server.

Because this involves a web server and a web browser, these exercises can't
be run on an online Python REPL. The kids will need a real computer capable
of running Python locally, and they'll need to be able to install a few Python
libraries using `pip`. You should carefully run through the [setup requirements](setup.md)
before deciding if this project is right for you.

You may find [solutions at this page](solutions.md).

# Timings

Assuming you take reasonable time (30 minutes) on various bits of introduction
and talk, and 20 minutes for setup, here's how much of the exercises can be done with
a capable GCSE class:

* 3 hours: exercise 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 4a only.
* 4 hours, if they're an especially capable group: add 2c
* > 4 hours: add 4b
* Whole day: add the rest (note that exercise 3 can't be done on Windows).
