# Exercise 1b: Using our own browser

* Do the same in our own browser, by running `python3 src/browser/browser.py`
* Does it support:
  * **Bold** text
  * _Italic_ text
  * Hyperlinks
* Open up the browser source code (open the file `src/browser/browser.py`) -
  it's recommended to use Visual Studio Code
* Find where it handles these tags. See which is missing.

## About reading code

This exercise is about _reading_ code, not writing it. It's a different skill!
Look for clues. See if you can piece together how the whole browser works,
by cross-referencing the way different bits of the code work with each other.
Use "find" (or equivalent options in Visual Studio Code).

**Top tip**: try to understand how the whole thing roughly fits together
before sweating on the details.
